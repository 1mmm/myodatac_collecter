# **MYO DATA COLLECTOR**


## **How to start**

Just need to load myodatac_collecter\collecter\hello-myo-VisualStudio2012.vcxproj   to  start collecting data. <br>
After that run myodatac_collecter\dealing\main.m to deal with the data.<br>
## **Something important**

The only thing you should do after collectting data is copying the folder which create by collecter just now to where main.m is located in.</br>
